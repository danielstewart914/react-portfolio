## Description

A simple React based Portfolio for Homework assignment.

## My Favorite Things

I enjoy being creative and wanted to shout out my favorite parts of this project.

* I created a hand coded SVG for my personal logo based on an initial draft logo created I in draw.io to use as a favicon.
* Created a simple command line tool for adding additional Projects to my portfolio simply by answering a few prompts from inquirer.
